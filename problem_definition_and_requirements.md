# Problem Definition and requirements

## Problem definition
There is no system or protocol for organizing and disseminating maintenance related knowledge from one maintenance manager to the next, or from any one person to another.

  - People do not know where maintenance related appliances are.  This information lives within the heads of a small group of people that are too busy with other responsibilities to be regular or reliable references.  Even so, these people are often not able to recall where every single unit of a given item is located, never-the-less how to communicate this information to someone else.
  - People do not know what maintenance related appliances are and how they work.  As a result of the general problem definition, incoming maintenance managers are left with a campus full of machines they can not identify or service.
  - People do not know how to service maintenance appliances. There are two types of tasks:
    - Recurring tasks
    - Discrete tasks
  - Thereâ€™s no organized place to find the information of when to service maintenance appliances and see the history of when they have been serviced.

  - When a maintenance manager comes onboard, they need to know:
    - What are the novel things that I need to do 
    - What are the recurring things that I need to do

The problem is not tracking the backlog of what needs to happen. This can exist on a whiteboard or a legal pad. The problem is acquainting a manager or a server with the various maintenance appliances of the center and the what, when, where and how mentioned above.

  - Maintenance appliances include (name & acronym): 
    - ERU
    - AHUs 
    - Water filters
    - Boilers
    - etc
